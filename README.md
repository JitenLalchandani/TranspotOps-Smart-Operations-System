# TransitOps AI — Fleet Intelligence Platform

A premium, full-stack SaaS dashboard for transit fleet management. Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase (PostgreSQL). Features secure authentication with role-based access control, complete CRUD modules, business-rule enforcement, interactive analytics, and a polished glassmorphism UI with dark/light mode.

## Features

### Authentication & RBAC
- Email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
- Five roles: **Admin**, **Fleet Manager**, **Driver**, **Safety Officer**, **Financial Analyst**
- Role-based navigation and dashboard views
- Protected routes — unauthenticated users are redirected to sign-in
- Auto-created user profiles on signup (via database trigger)
- Demo accounts for each role (one-click access)

### Fleet Modules (Full CRUD)
- **Vehicles** — registration number (unique), model, type, load capacity, odometer, acquisition cost, status, insurance details, document uploads
- **Drivers** — license details, expiry date, safety score, contact info, status
- **Trips** — origin/destination, cargo weight, revenue, dispatch/complete/cancel lifecycle
- **Maintenance** — service type, cost, open/closed lifecycle, service history
- **Fuel Logs** — liters, cost, odometer reading, efficiency tracking
- **Expenses** — category-based operational cost tracking

### Business Rules (Trip Management)
- Only **available** vehicles and drivers can be assigned
- **Retired** and **In-Shop** vehicles are excluded from selection
- Drivers with **expired licenses** or **suspended** status cannot be assigned
- Cargo weight **cannot exceed** vehicle load capacity
- **Dispatching** a trip sets vehicle and driver status to "On Trip"
- **Completing** or **cancelling** a trip restores both to "Available"
- **Creating** maintenance sets vehicle status to "In Shop"
- **Closing** maintenance restores vehicle to "Available"

### Analytics Dashboard
- KPIs: Active Vehicles, Available Vehicles, In Maintenance, Active Trips, Pending Trips, Drivers On Duty, Fleet Utilization, Fuel Efficiency, Operational Cost, Revenue, Profit, Vehicle ROI
- Interactive charts: profit trend, maintenance cost trend, fuel consumption, vehicle status distribution (donut), expense breakdown (donut)
- Compliance alerts for expiring licenses and insurance

### UI/UX
- Glassmorphism design with backdrop blur
- Dark/light mode toggle (persisted to localStorage)
- Fully responsive (mobile → desktop)
- Toast notifications
- Loading states and error handling
- Search, filters, sorting, and pagination on every table
- CSV and PDF export on all modules
- In-app notifications
- Profile management and settings page

## Database Schema

Nine tables with Row Level Security enabled on all:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `profiles` | Extends `auth.users` with role, name, phone, avatar |
| `vehicles` | Fleet vehicles with insurance and status |
| `drivers` | Drivers with license and safety score |
| `trips` | Trip assignments linking vehicles + drivers |
| `maintenance` | Service records with open/closed lifecycle |
| `fuel_logs` | Fuel entries for efficiency tracking |
| `expenses` | Operational expenses by category |
| `notifications` | Per-user in-app notifications |
| `documents` | Vehicle document upload metadata |

A database trigger (`handle_new_user_profile`) auto-creates a profile row when a user signs up, copying the email, full name, and role from signup metadata.
